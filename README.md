# COVID Trends Explorer (Python + SQL)

## Goal

This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). It performs extraction, cleaning, and storage of data using Python and SQLite, then queries meaningful insights with SQL.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- SQLite
- SQL
- Git + GitHub

## Data Source

- [`owid-covid-data.csv`](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv)

## Work in Progress

- [x] Initialized GitHub repo
- [x] Loaded 98MB+ CSV into Pandas
- [x] Inspected dataset structure
- [x] Cleaned and selected key columns (cases, deaths, vax, etc.)
- [x] Converted date to datetime format
- [x] Saved clean DataFrame to `covid_data.db` using SQLite
- [x] Created `.gitignore` to exclude the database file
- [x] Committed and pushed Day 1 progress
- [ ] Write and test SQL queries on the database
- [ ] Document insights and finalize README
- [ ] Add visual polish and post on LinkedIn
